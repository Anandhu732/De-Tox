# Focus? Never Heard of It! üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: De-Tox

### Team Members

- Team Lead: Anaya - SCMS College of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Anandhu - SCMS College of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description

A chaotically brilliant web game that challenges players to complete impossible tasks like keeping their mouse on a moving target for 10 seconds. Features three frustratingly entertaining games: Hover Hell, Click Chaos, and Dodge Disaster - each designed to be maximally irritating yet surprisingly addictive!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People have way too much focus and concentration these days! They can actually complete tasks without getting distracted. This is clearly a crisis that needs immediate attention. Plus, existing games are far too easy and actually let you win sometimes.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We've created the most impossible game collection ever! Our AI-powered targets use "quantum mechanics" to predict where you DON'T want them to be, complete with sarcastic commentary and popup spam. It's like having a digital nemesis that exists solely to mock your mouse skills!

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

For Software:

- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4.2 (Lightning-fast development)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 3.4.1 (Utility-first CSS framework)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM 7.8.0
- **Icons**: Lucide React 0.344.0 (Beautiful icon library)
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback)
- **Browser APIs**: localStorage (score persistence), AudioContext (sound effects)
- **Development Tools**: ESLint, TypeScript compiler, PostCSS, Autoprefixer

For Hardware:

- **Primary Component**: Your patience (not included)
- **Required Hardware**: Any device with a mouse/trackpad and the will to suffer
- **Specifications**: Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled, steady internet connection for maximum frustration
- **Tools Required**: A sense of humor and possibly anger management therapy

### Implementation

For Software:

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Anandhu732/De-Tox.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd De-Tox

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
# Opens on http://localhost:5173 (or next available port)

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

## Game Features

- **Hover Hell**: Keep your mouse on a moving target for 10 seconds (spoiler: impossible)
- **Click Chaos**: Click fast-moving targets before they escape (they will escape)
- **Dodge Disaster**: Avoid obstacles while they mock your reflexes relentlessly
- **Leaderboard**: Track your failures with persistent localStorage scores
- **Sarcastic Commentary**: AI-powered insults to enhance your gaming experience
- **Proximity Detection**: Targets actively run away when you get close
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Games get progressively more impossible
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for maximum sensory chaos
- **Responsive Design**: Frustration guaranteed on any device size

## Key Technical Features

- **Real-time Mouse Tracking**: Advanced cursor position detection with proximity calculations
- **Physics-based Movement**: Targets use velocity vectors and collision detection for realistic evasion
- **State Management**: Complex game state handling with React hooks and refs
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering with requestAnimationFrame game loops
- **Persistent Storage**: LocalStorage integration for cross-session score tracking
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-friendly design with touch event support
- **Audio Integration**: Web Audio API for dynamic sound generation
